## About

This repository is a compilation of all of my personal and work-related projects from March 2019 to present

NOTE: *Some projects in this repository are incomplete, either due to time constraints, space constraints, boredom, or confidentiality. 
Some projects may have incomplete dependencies.*
  
## Me

I've been coding for nearly a decade, first with 
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)'s Computer Programming platform in JS, then with 
[Processing](https://www.processing.org) in their proprietary visual Java framework, and now with a ton of different languages, IDEs, and platforms
(Python, Unity/C#, HTML/CSS, C++). My passion for programming started in game development, but likewise has spread to many corners of the
CS universe. These projects represent the odd agglomeration of my game dev, data science, machine learning, physics, web, and other miscelanious
projects.

## Structure

This repository is currently structured as follows:
+ Various side projects are stored in the folder corresponding to which year I wrote them in
  - These folders contain projects with different languages, dependencies, and platform requirements
  - Individual project README's are on the way!
+ More significant projects are stored separately
  - These are completed projects, but still may be missing some dependencies depending on confidentiality or space constraints.
    Check each README for more info.
+ Significant projects created in 2023 or later will have their own dedicated repositories
